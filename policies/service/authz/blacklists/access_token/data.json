    "description": "Used for banning clients with specific access tokens from using any of our public APIs. Each entry in a list is an _identifier_ of some access token. Broadly speaking, what constitutes an _identifier_ depends on which _tokens_ are we talking about. Though for the foreseeable future, we consider only JWTs where JWT's identifier is the value of the 'jti' claim.",
